### 4 steps of basic computeing

- input
- storage
- processing
- output

### Binary

- uses 1 or 0
- organized on octects or bytes
- each position  hold a power of 2
- 1010 = 10
- any number can be represented this way
- you can inturn represent other things such as text sound of anythign else as a number

### Circuits

-and circuites only returns 1 one if both inputs are 1

- or curtuits wil return a one if either are 1

- there is a circuit of each type of binary operation

- they can be combined to take ever more complex inputs

### Input

- input is sent to the CPU in binary
- the CPU sotres and converts input into output
- then the cpu send the output to the appropriate output device.
